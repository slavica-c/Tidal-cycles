# Quick guide to contributing a change to Tidal

The main repository is maintained on github:
  https://github.com/tidalcycles/tidalcycles.github.io

The SuperDirt repository is here:
  https://github.com/musikinformatik/SuperDirt

We'd like to add some instructions for how to interact with these but
no one has done it yet. For now some bullet points as a placeholder:

* Make a dev fork
* Make and test a change
* Keep your fork up to date with the master
* Make a pull request

# A process for making a release

Likewise, we'd like to describe how to..

* Share with others for testing
* Tagging release
* Uploading to hackage (currently I think only @yaxu can do this - need to look into how to get others doing that)
