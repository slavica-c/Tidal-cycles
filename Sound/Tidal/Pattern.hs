{- | (The above is difficult to describe, if you don't understand Haskell,
just read the description and examples..)

The `spread` function allows you to take a pattern transformation
which takes a parameter, such as `slow`, and provide several
parameters which are switched between. In other words it 'spreads' a
function across several values.

Taking a simple high hat loop as an example:

@
d1 $ sound "ho ho:2 ho:3 hc"
@

We can slow it down by different amounts, such as by a half:

@
d1 $ slow 2 $ sound "ho ho:2 ho:3 hc"
@

Or by four thirds (i.e. speeding it up by a third; `4%3` means four over
three):

@
d1 $ slow (4%3) $ sound "ho ho:2 ho:3 hc"
@

But if we use `spread`, we can make a pattern which alternates between
the two speeds:

@
d1 $ spread slow [2,4%3] $ sound "ho ho:2 ho:3 hc"
@

-}
spread :: (a -> t -> Pattern b) -> [a] -> t -> Pattern b
spread f xs p = cat $ map (\x -> f x p) xs

{- | `slowspread` takes a list of pattern transforms and applies them one at a time, per cycle, 
then repeats.

Example:

@
d1 $ slowspread ($) [density 2, rev, slow 2, striate 3, (# speed "0.8")] 
    $ sound "[bd*2 [~ bd]] [sn future]*2 cp jvbass*4"
@

Above, the pattern will have these transforms applied to it, one at a time, per cycle:

* cycle 1: `density 2` - pattern will increase in speed
* cycle 2: `rev` - pattern will be reversed
* cycle 3: `slow 2` - pattern will decrease in speed
* cycle 4: `striate 3` - pattern will be granualized
* cycle 5: `(# speed "0.8")` - pattern samples will be played back more slowly

After `(# speed "0.8")`, the transforms will repeat and start at `density 2` again.
-}
slowspread :: (a -> t -> Pattern b) -> [a] -> t -> Pattern b
slowspread f xs p = slowcat $ map (\x -> f x p) xs

{- | There's a version of this function, `spread'` (pronounced "spread prime"), which takes a *pattern* of parameters, instead of a list:

@
d1 $ spread' slow "2 4%3" $ sound "ho ho:2 ho:3 hc"
@

This is quite a messy area of Tidal - due to a slight difference of
implementation this sounds completely different! One advantage of
using `spread'` though is that you can provide polyphonic parameters, e.g.:

@
d1 $ spread' slow "[2 4%3, 3]" $ sound "ho ho:2 ho:3 hc"

`rand` generates a continuous pattern of (pseudo-)random, floating point numbers between `0` and `1`.

@

makes the snares' randomly loud and quiet.

Numbers coming from this pattern are random, but dependent on time. So if you reset time via `cps (-1)` the random pattern will emit the exact same _random_ numbers again.

In cases where you need two different random patterns, you can shift one of them around to change the time from which the _random_ pattern is read, note the difference:

@
d1 $ jux (|+| gain rand) $ sound "sn sn ~ sn" # gain rand

@

There are some aliases as well:

   # speed "2"
@

The shorthand syntax for `degrade` is a question mark: `?`. Using `?`
will allow you to randomly remove events from a portion of a pattern:

@
d1 $ slow 2 $ sound "bd ~ sn bd ~ bd? [sn bd?] ~"
@

You can also use `?` to randomly remove events from entire sub-patterns:

{- | `whenmod` has a similar form and behavior to `every`, but requires an 
additional number. Applies the function to the pattern, when the
remainder of the current loop number divided by the first parameter,
is less than the second parameter.

as dense:

@
d1 $ whenmod 8 4 (density 2) (sound "bd sn kurt")

`superimpose` plays a modified version of a pattern at the same time as the original pattern,
resulting in two patterns being played at the same time.

{- | Plays a portion of a pattern, specified by a beginning and end arc of time. 
The new resulting pattern is played over the time period of the original pattern:

@

In the pattern above, `zoom` is used with an arc from 25% to 75%. It is equivalent to this pattern:

@

@
-}
zoom :: Arc -> Pattern a -> Pattern a

{- | The `fit` function takes a pattern of integer numbers, which are used to select values from the given list. What makes this a bit strange is that only a given number of values are selected each cycle. For example:

@
d1 $ sound (fit 3 ["bd", "sn", "arpy", "arpy:1", "casio"] "0 [~ 1] 2 1")
@

The above fits three samples into the pattern, i.e. for the first cycle this will be `"bd"`, `"sn"` and `"arpy"`, giving the result `"bd [~ sn] arpy sn"` (note that we start counting at zero, so that `0` picks the first value). The following cycle the *next* three values in the list will be picked, i.e. `"arpy:1"`, `"casio"` and `"bd"`, giving the pattern `"arpy:1 [~ casio] bd casio"` (note that the list wraps round here).

{- | `fit'` is a generalization of `fit`, where the list is instead constructed by using another integer pattern to slice up a given pattern.  The first argument is the number of cycles of that latter pattern to use when slicing.  It's easier to understand this with a few examples:

@
d1 $ sound (fit' 1 2 "0 1" "1 0" "bd sn")
@

So what does this do?  The first `1` just tells it to slice up a single cycle of `"bd sn"`. The `2` tells it to select two values each cycle, just like the first argument to `fit`.  The next pattern `"0 1"` is the "from" pattern which tells it how to slice, which in this case means `"0"` maps to `"bd"`, and `"1"` maps to `"sn"`.  The next pattern `"1 0"` is the "to" pattern, which tells it how to rearrange those slices.  So the final result is the pattern `"sn bd"`.

A more useful example might be something like

@
d1 $ fit' 1 4 (run 4) "[0 3*2 2 1 0 3*2 2 [1*8 ~]]/2" $ chop 4 $ (sound "breaks152" # unit "c")
@

which uses `chop` to break a single sample into individual pieces, which `fit'` then puts into a list (using the `run 4` pattern) and reassembles according to the complicated integer pattern.
