{- | (The above is difficult to describe, if you don't understand Haskell,
just ignore it and read the below..)

The `spread` function allows you to take a pattern transformation
which takes a parameter, such as `slow`, and provide several
parameters which are switched between. In other words it 'spreads' a
function across several values.

Taking a simple high hat loop as an example:

@
d1 $ sound "ho ho:2 ho:3 hc"
@

We can slow it down by different amounts, such as by a half:

@
d1 $ slow 2 $ sound "ho ho:2 ho:3 hc"
@

Or by four thirds (i.e. speeding it up by a third; `4%3` means four over
three):

@
d1 $ slow (4%3) $ sound "ho ho:2 ho:3 hc"
@

But if we use `spread`, we can make a pattern which alternates between
the two speeds:

@
d1 $ spread slow [2,4%3] $ sound "ho ho:2 ho:3 hc"
@

Note that if you pass ($) as the function to spread values over, you
can put functions as the list of values. For example:

@
d1 $ spread ($) [density 2, rev, slow 2, striate 3, (# speed "0.8")]
    $ sound "[bd*2 [~ bd]] [sn future]*2 cp jvbass*4"
@

Above, the pattern will have these transforms applied to it, one at a time, per cycle:

* cycle 1: `density 2` - pattern will increase in speed
* cycle 2: `rev` - pattern will be reversed
* cycle 3: `slow 2` - pattern will decrease in speed
* cycle 4: `striate 3` - pattern will be granualized
* cycle 5: `(# speed "0.8")` - pattern samples will be played back more slowly

After `(# speed "0.8")`, the transforms will repeat and start at `density 2` again.

spread :: (a -> t -> Pattern b) -> [a] -> t -> Pattern b
spread f xs p = slowcat $ map (\x -> f x p) xs

slowspread :: (a -> t -> Pattern b) -> [a] -> t -> Pattern b
slowspread = spread

{- | @fastspread@ works the same as @spread@, but the result is squashed into a single cycle. If you gave four values to @spread@, then the result would seem to speed up by a factor of four. Compare these two:

d1 $ spread chop [4,64,32,16] $ sound "ho ho:2 ho:3 hc"

d1 $ fastspread chop [4,64,32,16] $ sound "ho ho:2 ho:3 hc"

@

This is quite a messy area of Tidal - due to a slight difference of
implementation this sounds completely different! One advantage of
using `spread'` though is that you can provide polyphonic parameters, e.g.:

@
d1 $ spread' slow "[2 4%3, 3]" $ sound "ho ho:2 ho:3 hc"

This will apply `striate 4` for every _even_ cycle and aply `# coarse "24 48"` for every _odd_.

Detail: As you can see the test function is arbitrary and does not rely on anything tidal specific. In fact it uses only plain haskell functionality, that is: it calculates the modulo of 2 of the current cycle which is either 0 (for even cycles) or 1. It then compares this value against 0 and returns the result, which is either `True` or `False`. This is what the `ifp` signature's first part signifies `(Int -> Bool)`, a function that takes a whole number and returns either `True` or `False`.

`rand` generates a continuous pattern of (pseudo-)random, floating point numbers between `0` and `1`.

Numbers coming from this pattern are random, but dependent on time. So if you reset time via `cps (-1)` the random pattern will emit the exact same _random_ numbers again.

In cases where you need two different random patterns, you can shift one of them around to change the time from which the _random_ pattern is read, note the difference:

@
d1 $ jux (|+| gain rand) $ sound "sn sn ~ sn" # gain rand

{- | You can use the @e@ function to apply a Euclidean algorithm over a
complex pattern, although the structure of that pattern will be lost:

In the above, three sounds are picked from the pattern on the right according
to the structure given by the `e 3 8`. It ends up picking two `bd` sounds, a
`cp` and missing the `sn` entirely.

These types of sequences use "Bjorklund's algorithm", which wasn't made for
music but for an application in nuclear physics, which is exciting. More
exciting still is that it is very similar in structure to the one of the first
known algorithms written in Euclid's book of elements in 300 BC. You can read

{- | The `fit` function takes a pattern of integer numbers, which are used to select values from the given list. What makes this a bit strange is that only a given number of values are selected each cycle. For example:

@
d1 $ sound (fit 3 ["bd", "sn", "arpy", "arpy:1", "casio"] "0 [~ 1] 2 1")
@

The above fits three samples into the pattern, i.e. for the first cycle this will be `"bd"`, `"sn"` and `"arpy"`, giving the result `"bd [~ sn] arpy sn"` (note that we start counting at zero, so that `0` picks the first value). The following cycle the *next* three values in the list will be picked, i.e. `"arpy:1"`, `"casio"` and `"bd"`, giving the pattern `"arpy:1 [~ casio] bd casio"` (note that the list wraps round here).

{-|
Removes events from second pattern that don't start during an event from first.

Consider this, kind of messy rhythm without any rests.

@
d1 $ sound (slowcat ["sn*8", "[cp*4 bd*4, hc*5]"]) # n (run 8)
@

If we apply a mask to it

@
d1 $ s (mask ("1 1 1 ~ 1 1 ~ 1" :: Pattern Bool)
  (slowcat ["sn*8", "[cp*4 bd*4, bass*5]"] ))
  # n (run 8)
@

Due to the use of `slowcat` here, the same mask is first applied to `"sn*8"` and in the next cycle to `"[cp*4 bd*4, hc*5]".

You could achieve the same effect by adding rests within the `slowcat` patterns, but mask allows you to do this more easily. It kind of keeps the rhythmic structure and you can change the used samples independently, e.g.

@
d1 $ s (mask ("1 ~ 1 ~ 1 1 ~ 1" :: Pattern Bool)
  (slowcat ["can*8", "[cp*4 sn*4, jvbass*16]"] ))
  # n (run 8)
@

Detail: It is currently needed to explicitly _tell_ Tidal that the mask itself is a `Pattern Bool` as it cannot infer this by itself, otherwise it will complain as it does not know how to interpret your input.

{- | `fit'` is a generalization of `fit`, where the list is instead constructed by using another integer pattern to slice up a given pattern.  The first argument is the number of cycles of that latter pattern to use when slicing.  It's easier to understand this with a few examples:

@
d1 $ sound (fit' 1 2 "0 1" "1 0" "bd sn")
@

So what does this do?  The first `1` just tells it to slice up a single cycle of `"bd sn"`. The `2` tells it to select two values each cycle, just like the first argument to `fit`.  The next pattern `"0 1"` is the "from" pattern which tells it how to slice, which in this case means `"0"` maps to `"bd"`, and `"1"` maps to `"sn"`.  The next pattern `"1 0"` is the "to" pattern, which tells it how to rearrange those slices.  So the final result is the pattern `"sn bd"`.

A more useful example might be something like

@
d1 $ fit' 1 4 (run 4) "[0 3*2 2 1 0 3*2 2 [1*8 ~]]/2" $ chop 4 $ (sound "breaks152" # unit "c")
@

which uses `chop` to break a single sample into individual pieces, which `fit'` then puts into a list (using the `run 4` pattern) and reassembles according to the complicated integer pattern.
