{- | `spin` will "spin" a layer up a pattern the given number of times,
with each successive layer offset in time by an additional `1/n` of a
cycle, and panned by an additional `1/n`. The result is a pattern that
seems to spin around. This function works best on multichannel
systems.

{- | Striate is a kind of granulator, for example:

@
d1 $ striate 3 $ sound "ho ho:2 ho:3 hc"
@

This plays the loop the given number of times, but triggering
progressive portions of each sample. So in this case it plays the loop
three times, the first time playing the first third of each sample,
then the second time playing the second third of each sample, etc..
With the highhat samples in the above example it sounds a bit like
reverb, but it isn't really.

You can also use striate with very long samples, to cut it into short
chunks and pattern those chunks. This is where things get towards
granular synthesis. The following cuts a sample into 128 parts, plays
it over 8 cycles and manipulates those parts by reversing and rotating
the loops.

@
d1 $  slow 8 $ striate 128 $ sound "bev"
@
-}

striate :: Pattern Int -> ControlPattern -> ControlPattern

_striate :: Int -> ControlPattern -> ControlPattern
_striate n p = fastcat $ map offset [0 .. n-1]

{-|
The `striateBy` function is a variant of `striate` with an extra
parameter, which specifies the length of each part. The `striateBy`
function still scans across the sample over a single cycle, but if
each bit is longer, it creates a sort of stuttering effect. For
example the following will cut the bev sample into 32 parts, but each
will be 1/16th of a sample long:

@
d1 $ slow 32 $ striateBy 32 (1/16) $ sound "bev"
@

Note that `striate` uses the `begin` and `end` parameters
internally. This means that if you're using `striate` (or `striateBy`)
you probably shouldn't also specify `begin` or `end`. -}

{- | `gap` is similar to `chop` in that it granualizes every sample in place as it is played,
but every other grain is silent. Use an integer value to specify how many granules
each sample is chopped into:

{- |
`weave` applies a function smoothly over an array of different patterns. It uses an `OscPattern` to
apply the function at different levels to each pattern, creating a weaving effect.

@
-}
weave :: Time -> ControlPattern -> [ControlPattern] -> ControlPattern
weave t p ps = weave' t p (map (#) ps)


{- | `weaveWith` is similar in that it blends functions at the same time at different amounts over a pattern:

@
d1 $ weaveWith 3 (sound "bd [sn drum:2*2] bd*2 [sn drum:1]") [density 2, (# speed "0.5"), chop 16]
@

(A function that takes two ControlPatterns, and blends them together into
a new ControlPattern. An ControlPattern is basically a pattern of messages to
a synthesiser.)

Shifts between the two given patterns, using distortion.

{- | Just like `striate`, but also loops each sample chunk a number of times specified in the second argument.
The primed version is just like `striateBy`, where the loop count is the third argument. For example:

@
d1 $ striateL' 3 0.125 4 $ sound "feel sn:2"

Like `striate`, these use the `begin` and `end` parameters internally, as well as the `loop` parameter for these versions.

`loopAt` makes a sample fit the given number of cycles. Internally, it
works by setting the `unit` parameter to "c", changing the playback
speed of the sample with the `speed` parameter, and setting setting
the `density` of the pattern to match.

@
d1 $ loopAt 4 $ sound "breaks125"
d1 $ juxBy 0.6 (|* speed "2") $ slowspread (loopAt) [4,6,2,3] $ chop 12 $ sound "fm:14"

{- | Smash is a combination of `spread` and `striate` - it cuts the samples
into the given number of bits, and then cuts between playing the loop
at different speeds according to the values in the list.

So this:

@
d1 $ smash 3 [2,3,4] $ sound "ho ho:2 ho:3 hc"
@

Is a bit like this:

@
d1 $ spread (slow) [2,3,4] $ striate 3 $ sound "ho ho:2 ho:3 hc"
@

This is quite dancehall:

@
d1 $ (spread' slow "1%4 2 1 3" $ spread (striate) [2,3,4,1] $ sound
"sn:2 sid:3 cp sid:4")
  # speed "[1 2 1 1]/2"
@

{- |
    Applies a type of delay to a pattern.
    It has three parameters, which could be called depth, time and feedback.

    This adds a bit of echo:
    @
    d1 $ echo 4 0.2 0.5 $ sound "bd sn"
    @

    The above results in 4 echos, each one 50% quieter than the last, with 1/5th of a cycle between them.

    It is possible to reverse the echo:
    @
    d1 $ echo 4 (-0.2) 0.5 $ sound "bd sn"
    @
-}
echo :: Pattern Integer -> Pattern Rational -> Pattern Double -> ControlPattern -> ControlPattern
echo = tParam3 _echo

    Allows to apply a function for each step and overlays the result delayed by the given time.

    @
    d1 $ echoWith 2 "1%3" (# vowel "{a e i o u}%2") $ sound "bd sn"

    In this case there are two _overlays_ delayed by 1/3 of a cycle, where each has the @vowel@ filter applied.
