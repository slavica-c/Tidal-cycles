`rand` generates a continuous pattern of (pseudo-)random numbers between `0` and `1`.

@
sound "bd*8" # pan rand
@

pans bass drums randomly

@
sound "sn sn ~ sn" # gain rand
@

makes the snares' randomly loud and quiet.

Numbers coming from this pattern are 'seeded' by time. So if you reset
time (via `cps (-1)`, then `cps 1.1` or whatever cps you want to
restart with) the random pattern will emit the exact same _random_
numbers again.

In cases where you need two different random patterns, you can shift
one of them around to change the time from which the _random_ pattern
is read, note the difference:

@
jux (# gain rand) $ sound "sn sn ~ sn" # gain rand
@

and with the juxed version shifted backwards for 1024 cycles:

@
jux (# ((1024 <~) $ gain rand)) $ sound "sn sn ~ sn" # gain rand

{- | The 'spread' function allows you to take a pattern transformation
which takes a parameter, such as `slow`, and provide several
parameters which are switched between. In other words it 'spreads' a
function across several values.

Taking a simple high hat loop as an example:

@
d1 $ sound "ho ho:2 ho:3 hc"
@

We can slow it down by different amounts, such as by a half:

@
d1 $ slow 2 $ sound "ho ho:2 ho:3 hc"
@

Or by four thirds (i.e. speeding it up by a third; `4%3` means four over
three):

@
d1 $ slow (4%3) $ sound "ho ho:2 ho:3 hc"
@

But if we use `spread`, we can make a pattern which alternates between
the two speeds:

@
d1 $ spread slow [2,4%3] $ sound "ho ho:2 ho:3 hc"
@

Note that if you pass ($) as the function to spread values over, you
can put functions as the list of values. For example:

@
d1 $ spread ($) [density 2, rev, slow 2, striate 3, (# speed "0.8")]
    $ sound "[bd*2 [~ bd]] [sn future]*2 cp jvbass*4"
@

Above, the pattern will have these transforms applied to it, one at a time, per cycle:

* cycle 1: `density 2` - pattern will increase in speed
* cycle 2: `rev` - pattern will be reversed
* cycle 3: `slow 2` - pattern will decrease in speed
* cycle 4: `striate 3` - pattern will be granualized
* cycle 5: `(# speed "0.8")` - pattern samples will be played back more slowly

After `(# speed "0.8")`, the transforms will repeat and start at `density 2` again.
-}

spread :: (a -> t -> Pattern b) -> [a] -> t -> Pattern b
spread f xs p = slowcat $ map (`f` p) xs

slowspread :: (a -> t -> Pattern b) -> [a] -> t -> Pattern b
slowspread = spread

{- | @fastspread@ works the same as @spread@, but the result is squashed into a single cycle. If you gave four values to @spread@, then the result would seem to speed up by a factor of four. Compare these two:

d1 $ spread chop [4,64,32,16] $ sound "ho ho:2 ho:3 hc"

d1 $ fastspread chop [4,64,32,16] $ sound "ho ho:2 ho:3 hc"

There is also @slowspread@, which is an alias of @spread@.
-}
fastspread :: (a -> t -> Pattern b) -> [a] -> t -> Pattern b
fastspread f xs p = fastcat $ map (`f` p) xs

{- | There's a version of this function, `spread'` (pronounced "spread prime"), which takes a *pattern* of parameters, instead of a list:

@
d1 $ spread' slow "2 4%3" $ sound "ho ho:2 ho:3 hc"
@

This is quite a messy area of Tidal - due to a slight difference of
implementation this sounds completely different! One advantage of
using `spread'` though is that you can provide polyphonic parameters, e.g.:

@
d1 $ spread' slow "[2 4%3, 3]" $ sound "ho ho:2 ho:3 hc"
@
-}
spread' :: Monad m => (a -> b -> m c) -> m a -> b -> m c
spread' f vpat pat = vpat >>= \v -> f v pat

{- | `spreadChoose f xs p` is similar to `slowspread` but picks values from
`xs` at random, rather than cycling through them in order. It has a
shorter alias `spreadr`.
-}
spreadChoose :: (t -> t1 -> Pattern b) -> [t] -> t1 -> Pattern b
spreadChoose f vs p = do v <- _segment 1 (choose vs)

{-| Decide whether to apply one or another function depending on the result of a test function that is passed the current cycle as a number.

@
d1 $ ifp ((== 0).(flip mod 2))
  (striate 4)
  (# coarse "24 48") $
  sound "hh hc"
@

This will apply `striate 4` for every _even_ cycle and aply `# coarse "24 48"` for every _odd_.

Detail: As you can see the test function is arbitrary and does not rely on anything tidal specific. In fact it uses only plain haskell functionality, that is: it calculates the modulo of 2 of the current cycle which is either 0 (for even cycles) or 1. It then compares this value against 0 and returns the result, which is either `True` or `False`. This is what the `ifp` signature's first part signifies `(Int -> Bool)`, a function that takes a whole number and returns either `True` or `False`.

wedge 0 _ p' = p'
wedge 1 p _ = p
wedge t p p' = overlay (_fastGap (1/t) p) (t `rotR` _fastGap (1/(1-t)) p')

{- | @whenmod@ has a similar form and behavior to `every`, but requires an
additional number. Applies the function to the pattern, when the
remainder of the current loop number divided by the first parameter,
is greater or equal than the second parameter.

For example the following makes every other block of four loops twice
as dense:

@
d1 $ whenmod 8 4 (density 2) (sound "bd sn kurt")
@
-}
whenmod :: Int -> Int -> (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a
whenmod a b = Sound.Tidal.Core.when (\t -> (t `mod` a) >= b )

{- |
@
superimpose f p = stack [p, f p]
@

`superimpose` plays a modified version of a pattern at the same time as the original pattern,
resulting in two patterns being played at the same time.

@
d1 $ superimpose (density 2) $ sound "bd sn [cp ht] hh"
d1 $ superimpose ((# speed "2") . (0.125 <~)) $ sound "bd sn cp hh"
@

-}
superimpose :: (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a
superimpose f p = stack [p, f p]

{- | @trunc@ truncates a pattern so that only a fraction of the pattern is played.
The following example plays only the first quarter of the pattern:

@
d1 $ trunc 0.25 $ sound "bd sn*2 cp hh*4 arpy bd*2 cp bd*2"
@
-}
trunc :: Pattern Time -> Pattern a -> Pattern a
trunc = tParam _trunc

_trunc :: Time -> Pattern a -> Pattern a
_trunc t = compress (0, t) . zoomArc (Arc 0 t)

{- | @linger@ is similar to `trunc` but the truncated part of the pattern loops until the end of the cycle

@
d1 $ linger 0.25 $ sound "bd sn*2 cp hh*4 arpy bd*2 cp bd*2"

linger :: Pattern Time -> Pattern a -> Pattern a
linger = tParam _linger

_linger :: Time -> Pattern a -> Pattern a
_linger n p = _fast (1/n) $ zoomArc (Arc 0 n) p

{- |
Use `within` to apply a function to only a part of a pattern. For example, to
apply `density 2` to only the first half of a pattern:

@
d1 $ within (0, 0.5) (density 2) $ sound "bd*2 sn lt mt hh hh hh hh"
@

Or, to apply `(# speed "0.5") to only the last quarter of a pattern:

@
d1 $ within (0.75, 1) (# speed "0.5") $ sound "bd*2 sn lt mt hh hh hh hh"
@
-}
within :: (Time, Time) -> (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a

                          ]

withinArc :: Arc -> (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a
withinArc (Arc s e) = within (s, e)

{- |
For many cases, @within'@ will function exactly as within.
The difference between the two occurs when applying functions that change the timing of notes such as 'fast' or '<~'.
within first applies the function to all notes in the cycle, then keeps the results in the specified interval, and then combines it with the old cycle (an "apply split combine" paradigm).
within' first keeps notes in the specified interval, then applies the function to these notes, and then combines it with the old cycle (a "split apply combine" paradigm).


For example, whereas using the standard version of within

@
d1 $ within (0, 0.25) (fast 2) $ sound "bd hh cp sd"
@

sounds like:

@
d1 $ sound "[bd hh] hh cp sd"
@

using this alternative version, within'

@
d1 $ within' (0, 0.25) (fast 2) $ sound "bd hh cp sd"
@

sounds like:

@
d1 $ sound "[bd bd] hh cp sd"
@

-}

within' :: (Time, Time) -> (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a
within' a@(s, e) f p =
  stack [ filterWhen (\t -> cyclePos t >= s && cyclePos t < e) $ compress a $ f $ zoom a p
        , filterWhen (\t -> not $ cyclePos t >= s && cyclePos t < e) p
        ]

{- | You can use the @e@ function to apply a Euclidean algorithm over a
complex pattern, although the structure of that pattern will be lost:

@
d1 $ e 3 8 $ sound "bd*2 [sn cp]"
@

In the above, three sounds are picked from the pattern on the right according
to the structure given by the `e 3 8`. It ends up picking two `bd` sounds, a
`cp` and missing the `sn` entirely.

These types of sequences use "Bjorklund's algorithm", which wasn't made for
music but for an application in nuclear physics, which is exciting. More
exciting still is that it is very similar in structure to the one of the first
known algorithms written in Euclid's book of elements in 300 BC. You can read
more about this in the paper

{- | The `fit` function takes a pattern of integer numbers, which are used to select values from the given list. What makes this a bit strange is that only a given number of values are selected each cycle. For example:

@
d1 $ sound (fit 3 ["bd", "sn", "arpy", "arpy:1", "casio"] "0 [~ 1] 2 1")
@

The above fits three samples into the pattern, i.e. for the first cycle this will be `"bd"`, `"sn"` and `"arpy"`, giving the result `"bd [~ sn] arpy sn"` (note that we start counting at zero, so that `0` picks the first value). The following cycle the *next* three values in the list will be picked, i.e. `"arpy:1"`, `"casio"` and `"bd"`, giving the pattern `"arpy:1 [~ casio] bd casio"` (note that the list wraps round here).

Removes events from second pattern that don't start during an event from first.

Consider this, kind of messy rhythm without any rests.

@
d1 $ sound (slowcat ["sn*8", "[cp*4 bd*4, hc*5]"]) # n (run 8)

d1 $ s (mask ("1 1 1 ~ 1 1 ~ 1" :: Pattern Bool)
  (slowcat ["sn*8", "[cp*4 bd*4, bass*5]"] ))
  # n (run 8)
@

Due to the use of `slowcat` here, the same mask is first applied to `"sn*8"` and in the next cycle to `"[cp*4 bd*4, hc*5]".

You could achieve the same effect by adding rests within the `slowcat` patterns, but mask allows you to do this more easily. It kind of keeps the rhythmic structure and you can change the used samples independently, e.g.

@
d1 $ s (mask ("1 ~ 1 ~ 1 1 ~ 1")
  (slowcat ["can*8", "[cp*4 sn*4, jvbass*16]"] ))

{- | `fit'` is a generalization of `fit`, where the list is instead constructed by using another integer pattern to slice up a given pattern.  The first argument is the number of cycles of that latter pattern to use when slicing.  It's easier to understand this with a few examples:

@
d1 $ sound (fit' 1 2 "0 1" "1 0" "bd sn")
@

So what does this do?  The first `1` just tells it to slice up a single cycle of `"bd sn"`. The `2` tells it to select two values each cycle, just like the first argument to `fit`.  The next pattern `"0 1"` is the "from" pattern which tells it how to slice, which in this case means `"0"` maps to `"bd"`, and `"1"` maps to `"sn"`.  The next pattern `"1 0"` is the "to" pattern, which tells it how to rearrange those slices.  So the final result is the pattern `"sn bd"`.

A more useful example might be something like

@
d1 $ fit' 1 4 (run 4) "[0 3*2 2 1 0 3*2 2 [1*8 ~]]/2" $ chop 4 $ (sound "breaks152" # unit "c")
@

which uses `chop` to break a single sample into individual pieces, which `fit'` then puts into a list (using the `run 4` pattern) and reassembles according to the complicated integer pattern.

{- | The `jux` function creates strange stereo effects, by applying a

@

When passing pattern transforms to functions like [jux](#jux) and [every](#every),
it's possible to chain multiple transforms together with `.`, for
example this both reverses and halves the playback speed of the
pattern in the righthand channel:

will put `iter 4` of the pattern to the far left and `palindrome` to the far right. In the center the original pattern will play and mid left mid right the chopped and the reversed version will appear.

bit much, especially when listening on headphones. The variant `juxBy`
has an additional parameter, which brings the channel closer to the
centre. For example:

@
d1 $ juxBy 0.5 (density 2) $ sound "bd sn:1"

In the above, the two versions of the pattern would be panned at 0.25
and 0.75, rather than 0 and 1.
