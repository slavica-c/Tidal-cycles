## 1.4.7 - Bleep

	* Fix BootTidal.hs - make loadable in atom @bgold-cosmos
	* More additions to tidal-parse @dktr0

## 1.4.6 - Megatron

	* Experimental ratio shorthand ref #573 @yaxu

	* New parameters for freq, overgain, overshape, and missing midi params including the new nrpn ones @yaxu

## 1.4.5 - Porter Brook

* Mini notation - `@` (and its alias `_`) now accepts rational relative durations. E.g. `a b@0.5 c d` to make `b` have a half step (that would be the same as `a@2 b c@2 c@d`). This can also be patterned `a b@<0.5 2> c d` @yaxu #435
* Experimental `reset` function - stick in a pattern so it acts as though the cycle number was reset to 0, from the next cycle @yaxu
* Bugfix for setR in BootTidal.hs @yaxu
* Mini notation - `!`, `@` and `_` now work properly within `{}` and `<>`, e.g. `<a b ! c!3 d>` will repeat every 7 cycles @yaxu #369 #248
* Mini notation - `@` and `_` are now aliases for each other, e.g. `a_3` is the same as `a@3` as are `_` and `@` @yaxu #369
* Frame skipping on clock jumps now configurable @yaxu #567
* Sync between tidal instances now works straight away, without having to setcps @yaxu #569
* New `while` function for applying a function selectively according to a binary pattern @yaxu
* Lowercases aliases `slowappend` and `fastappend` for `slowAppend` and `fastAppend` respectively @yaxu
* Many tidal-parse updates @dktr0

* wrandcat (weighted randcat) @yaxu
* MIDI Sysex support #558 @yaxu

## 0.9.10 (and earlier missing versions from this log)

* arpg, a function to arpeggiate

* slice upgraded to take a pattern of slice indexes
* espgrid support
* lindenmayerI
* sew function, for binary switching between two patterns
* somecycles alias for someCycles
* ply function, for repeating each event in a pattern a given number
  of times within their original timespan
* patternify juxBy, e, e', einv, efull, eoff

## 0.9.7

### Enhancements

* The `note` pattern parameter is no longer an alias for `midinote`,
  but an independent parameter for supercollider to handle (in a manner
  similar to `up`)
  
## 0.9.6

### Enhancements

* Added `chord` for chord patterns and `scaleP` for scale patterns
* The `n` pattern parameter is now floating point

## 0.9.5

### Enhancements

* Added `hurry` which both speeds up the sound and the pattern by the given amount.
* Added `stripe` which repeats a pattern a given number of times per
  cycle, with random but contiguous durations.
* Added continuous function `cosine`
* Turned more pattern transformation parameters into patterns - spread', striateX, every', inside, outside, swing
* Added experimental datatype for Xenakis sieves
* Correctly parse negative rationals
* Added `breakUp` that finds events that share the same timespan, and spreads them out during that timespan, so for example (breakUp "[bd,sn]") gets turned into the "bd sn"
* Added `fill` which 'fills in' gaps in one pattern with events from another. 

## 0.9.4

### Fixes

* Swapped `-` for `..` in ranges as quick fix for issue with parsing negative numbers
* Removed overloaded list thingie for now, unsure whether it's worth the dependency

## 0.9.3

### Enhancements

* The sequence parser can now expand ranges, e.g. `"0-3 4-2"` is
  equivalent to `"[0 1 2 3] [4 3 2]"`
* Sequences can now be described using list syntax, for example `sound ["bd", "sn"]` is equivalent to `sound "bd sn"`. They *aren't* lists though, so you can't for example do `sound (["bd", "sn"] ++ ["arpy", "cp"])` -- but can do `sound (append ["bd", "sn"]  ["arpy", "cp"])`
* New function `linger`, e.g. `linger (1/4)` will only play the first quarter of the given pattern, four times to fill the cycle. 
* `discretise` now takes time value as its first parameter, not a pattern of time, which was causing problems and needs some careful thought.
* a `rel` alias for the `release` parameter, to match the `att` alias for `attack`
* `_fast` alias for `_density`
* The start of automatic testing for a holy bug-free future

### Fixes

* Fixed bug that was causing events to double up or get lost,
  e.g. where `rev` was combined with certain other functions.
