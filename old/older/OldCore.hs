-- ** Constructing patterns

-- ** Manipulating time

-- the pattern to fit the slot given in the time pattern

-- | * Higher order functions

-- | Functions which work on other functions (higher order functions)

-- | @every n o f'@ is like @every n f@ with an offset of @o@ cycles
every' :: Pattern Int -> Pattern Int -> (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a
every' np op f p = do { n <- np; o <- op; _every' n o f p }

_every' :: Int -> Int -> (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a
_every' n o = when ((== o) . (`mod` n))

-- | @foldEvery ns f p@ applies the function @f@ to @p@, and is applied for
-- each cycle in @ns@.
foldEvery :: [Int] -> (Pattern a -> Pattern a) -> Pattern a -> Pattern a
foldEvery ns f p = foldr (`_every` f) p ns

{-|
Only `when` the given test function returns `True` the given pattern
transformation is applied. The test function will be called with the
current cycle as a number.

@
d1 $ when ((elem '4').show)
  (striate 4)
  $ sound "hh hc"
@

The above will only apply `striate 4` to the pattern if the current
cycle number contains the number 4. So the fourth cycle will be
striated and the fourteenth and so on. Expect lots of striates after
cycle number 399.
