{- | You can use the @e@ function to apply a Euclidean algorithm over a
complex pattern, although the structure of that pattern will be lost:

@
d1 $ e 3 8 $ sound "bd*2 [sn cp]"
@

In the above, three sounds are picked from the pattern on the right according
to the structure given by the `e 3 8`. It ends up picking two `bd` sounds, a
`cp` and missing the `sn` entirely.

A negative first argument provides the inverse of the euclidean pattern.

These types of sequences use "Bjorklund's algorithm", which wasn't made for
music but for an application in nuclear physics, which is exciting. More
exciting still is that it is very similar in structure to the one of the first
known algorithms written in Euclid's book of elements in 300 BC. You can read
more about this in the paper
[The Euclidean Algorithm Generates Traditional Musical Rhythms](http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~godfried/publications/banff.pdf)
