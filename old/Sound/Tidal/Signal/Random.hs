-- Pseudo-random waveforms

{-|

`rand` generates a continuous pattern of (pseudo-)random numbers between `0` and `1`.

@
sound "bd*8" # pan rand
@

pans bass drums randomly

@
sound "sn sn ~ sn" # gain rand
@

makes the snares' randomly loud and quiet.

Numbers coming from this pattern are 'seeded' by time. So if you reset
time (via `cps (-1)`, then `cps 1.1` or whatever cps you want to
restart with) the random pattern will emit the exact same _random_
numbers again.

In cases where you need two different random patterns, you can shift
one of them around to change the time from which the _random_ pattern
is read, note the difference:

@
jux (# gain rand) $ sound "sn sn ~ sn" # gain rand
@

and with the juxed version shifted backwards for 1024 cycles:

@
jux (# ((1024 <~) $ gain rand)) $ sound "sn sn ~ sn" # gain rand
@

repeat every cycle (because the saw does)

-- Signal degraders

{- |
Similar to `degrade` `degradeBy` allows you to control the percentage of events that
are removed. For example, to remove events 90% of the time:

@
d1 $ slow 2 $ degradeBy 0.9 $ sound "[[[feel:5*8,feel*3] feel:3*8], feel*4]"
   # accelerate "-6"
   # speed "2"

{- | Use @sometimesBy@ to apply a given function "sometimes". For example, the
following code results in `density 2` being applied about 25% of the time:

@
d1 $ sometimesBy 0.25 (density 2) $ sound "bd*8"
@

There are some aliases as well:

@
sometimes = sometimesBy 0.5
often = sometimesBy 0.75
rarely = sometimesBy 0.25
almostNever = sometimesBy 0.1
almostAlways = sometimesBy 0.9
@

{- | `degrade` randomly removes events from a pattern 50% of the time:

@
d1 $ slow 2 $ degrade $ sound "[[[feel:5*8,feel*3] feel:3*8], feel*4]"
   # accelerate "-6"
   # speed "2"
@

The shorthand syntax for `degrade` is a question mark: `?`. Using `?`
will allow you to randomly remove events from a portion of a pattern:

@
d1 $ slow 2 $ sound "bd ~ sn bd ~ bd? [sn bd?] ~"
@

You can also use `?` to randomly remove events from entire sub-patterns:

@
d1 $ slow 2 $ sound "[[[feel:5*8,feel*3] feel:3*8]?, feel*4]"
